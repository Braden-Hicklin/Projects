# Explanation
I attempted to create a server side autocompletion function for the monster types using node.js, express, and mysql. I created a database that contained every single 
enemy found in dnd 5e, and set up a node.js server alongside three other functions that were supposed to allow for the autocompletion. Unfortunately, I was unable to get
the functions working properly without needing to set up a bunch of digital servers to store the database.

There most likely is a much easier way of doing this than what I attempted, but this was all I could come up with and outside of this I'm not sure what other server side
scripts would benefit this website as is.
