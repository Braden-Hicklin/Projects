# This is a DnD 5e Enemy Creation Tool for DM's
## Purpose
The purpose behind this program is to improve the efficiency behind enemy creation for campaigns in Dungeons and Dragons Fifth Edition.
## Implementation
The program uses googles HTML service api to connect the form to a premade google sheet that updates everytime the user submits a new enemy using the form. It also uses
Bootstrapper for CSS styles, Jquery for some javascript functions, and Ionic Icons for icons. The Program features three webpages, a home page, a creation tool page, and
a monster manual page. The Home page provides a brief overview of what the tool does and an example of a filled out form. The Creation tool page is where the creation tool
form is located, this is where the users can fill out and submit the form for the enemy. Lastly, the monster manual page is where the user can find links to an interactive
monster manual, a monster compendium, a challenge rating explanation, and a challenge rating calculator.

## Notes
In order to use this program I had to create a .gs file using google HTML services, the file is linked but doesn't do anyting for the actual code, rather its just there
to show what is in the extension attatched to the google sheet. I included a link to the google sheet I made that should allow you to see it update in real time, if not
please email me and I can provide instructions for how to make a sheet yourself, or just show you via video call.
